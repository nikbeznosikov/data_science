### Project Description

This project involves analyzing a dataset of booking reviews to create new features, clean data, and build a predictive model that can accurately predict review outcomes. The analysis and modeling process is conducted using Python, focusing on feature engineering, data preprocessing, and machine learning. The dataset is sourced from a Kaggle competition: [SF Booking](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sf-booking).

### What problem does it solve?

The project aims to extract valuable insights from the booking reviews data and build a predictive model that can accurately predict the rating of a review based on the processed data.

**Steps involved:**

1. Feature engineering to create new, meaningful features from the existing data.
2. Data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
3. Building and training a machine learning model to predict review ratings based on the prepared data.

**What do we practice?**

- Feature engineering and creation
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Training and evaluating machine learning models

### Brief information about the data

The data consists of various features related to booking reviews, which undergo preprocessing and feature engineering before being used to train the model. The goal is to predict the rating of a review accurately.

### Stages of work on the project

1. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Create new features to enhance the predictive power of the model.

2. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Clean the data to ensure consistency and handle any missing values or outliers.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train a machine learning model on the prepared data.

### Results

The project resulted in the creation of a well-trained predictive model. The process included effective feature engineering, thorough data cleaning, and successful model training.
